Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure that the mailer has default URL options in each environment. Here is
     a possible configuration for `config/environments/development.rb`:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. You can copy Proclaim views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g proclaim:views
